/*
 * Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:

   Input: nums = [3,0,1]
   Output: 2 
   
   Explanation: n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the     range since it does not appear in nums.
Example 2:

   Input: nums = [0,1]
   Output: 2
   Explanation: n = 2 since there are 2 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,2]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.


 * 
 * First we are shorting the array 
 * 
 * Second we are assigning a the largest value + 1 because if arr[0] == 1 and also no number is misssing then the answer must be largest number +1 
 * 
 * Thirdly we are checking some edge cases
 * 
 * Thenn we are running the loop and checking the differnce between arr[i] and arr[i+1] if the difference is not 1 then return that number
 * 
 * It is a bruteforce approach which is accepted in leetcode.

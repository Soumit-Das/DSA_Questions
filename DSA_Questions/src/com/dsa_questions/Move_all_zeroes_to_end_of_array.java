/*
 * Given an array arr[] of N positive integers. Push all the zeros of the given array to the right end of the array while maintaining the order of non-zero elements.
 * 
 * 
 * Here we are using two pointers 
 * 
 * First pointer will start from 0 and Second pointer will start from 1
 * 
 * when The 1st pointer's value is 0 then that pointer will not increment but only the 2nd pointer will increment until it gets a value other than 0
 * 
 * When 2nd pointer gets a value then it swaps the value with the first pointer value and 1st pointer increment 
 * 
 * then 1st pointer increments 2nd pointer becomes +1 of 1st pointer
